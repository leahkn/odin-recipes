        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Oma always makes this for her grand kids after she picks through her garden. Probably not good for the thighs but Oma's cooking is always good for the taste buds.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking dish.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    In a large bowl, stir together 1 1/4 cups sugar, baking soda, salt and 2 cups flour. 
                    <br> Stir in the eggs and sour cream until smooth, then fold in the rhubarb. Pour into the prepared dish and spread evenly. 
                    <br> In a smaller bowl, stir together the remaining 1 cup sugar and butter until smooth. Stir in 1/4 cup flour until the mixture is crumbly. 
                    <br> Sprinkle the mixture on top of the cake then dust lightly with cinnamon.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
